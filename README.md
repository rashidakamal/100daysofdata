# 100daysofdata

## Project Proposal

I really want to develop greater fluency and depth of experience with a few data visualization workflows this summer. ITP has made me a big believer in "100 days of...something" projects. I'm embarking on a 100 days of data visualization project, to be documented here. I'm going to alternate between the following tools/workflows each day: 

1. Python (pandas + matplotlib + Adobe Illustrator)
2. D3 (+ some HTML/CSS)
3. Adobe After Effects

I intend to use the same dataset for days 1-3, and then begin the cycle anew with a different dataset. You can view my schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTw-UVBnVyEzsG05MljrP3pxRlMXEPCZn47lU6FyDyY/edit?usp=sharing).

I'll structure this repository into subfolders by dataset: 01-33 for the period of time. Each subfolder will contain the relevant data (when possible), a jupyter notebook for the Python analysis, an "index.html" for the D3 code, and a README to document the outputs of days 1-3, along with reflections, findings, and notes on new concepts and challenges. 

I'll also keep a running list of interesting datasets and data visualization inspiration here.
