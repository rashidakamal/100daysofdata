# 100 Days of Data Visualization

## Project Proposal

I really want to develop greater fluency and depth of experience with a few data visualization workflows this summer. ITP has made me a big believer in "100 days of...something" projects. I'm embarking on a 100 days of data visualization project, to be documented here. I'm going to alternate between the following tools/workflows each day: 

1. Python (pandas + matplotlib + Adobe Illustrator)
2. D3 (+ some HTML/CSS)
3. Adobe After Effects

I intend to use the same dataset for days 1-3, and then begin the cycle anew with a different dataset. You can view my schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTw-UVBnVyEzsG05MljrP3pxRlMXEPCZn47lU6FyDyY/edit?usp=sharing).

I'll structure this repository into subfolders by dataset: 01-33 for the period of time. Each subfolder will contain the relevant data (when possible), a jupyter notebook for the Python analysis, an "index.html" for the D3 code, and a README to document the outputs of days 1-3, along with reflections, findings, and notes on new concepts and challenges. 

I'll also keep a running list of interesting datasets and data visualization inspiration here. 

## Interesting Datasets

+ [NYC Civilian Complains Review Board](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-CCRB-Allegations-C/xyq2-jjkn)

## Inspiration

+ [NYTimes Coronavirus Tracking](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
    + Particularly notable here is the representation of data anomalies in their bar charts. The solution is simple: the use of a different color for days in which there was an anomaly in how the data was reported, with an accompanying and (easily accessibly) key with a link to a textual description of the anomaly. Love it.
